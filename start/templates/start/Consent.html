    <h2 style="text-align:center"> Welcome to our experiment!</h2>


    <p>
        Thank you for choosing to support our research by participating in our experiment! In doing so, you are making
        an important contribution to foundational linguistic research conducted at the Leibniz-Centre General
        Linguistics (ZAS). On this page we would like to inform you about the study.
    </p>

    <h3 style="text-align:center">What this study is about</h3>
    <p>
        This study examines how you use some English words when providing information for a specific decision problem.
        Your task as a native English speaker is to describe pictures and make decisions on certain actions.
    </p>

    <h3 style="text-align:center">What you can expect</h3>
    <p>
        After the next page, where we ask you to provide some general information about yourself, we will explain your
        task in more detail. This is followed by five practice rounds in which you will learn how to use the interface
        for this experiment. This will be followed by the actual experiment, which will consist of 21 rounds of
        describing pictures and 35 rounds of making decisions. We estimate that you will need about 30 minutes to
        complete the experiment. After the final round of the experiment, a web page will appear with a link that will
        take you back to Prolific and allow you to claim your Â£6.00 participation reward.
    </p>

    <h2 style="text-align:center">Privacy policy</h2>


    <h3 style="text-align:center">Risks to you</h3>

    There are no known risks to you in participating in this research.


    <h3 style="text-align:center">Your participation is voluntary</h3>

    <p>
        Your participation is voluntary, and you are free to withdraw at any time, without comment and without incurring
        any disadvantages for yourself.
    </p>

    <h3 style="text-align:center">Data storage</h3>

    <p>
        Your data will be safely stored, and we will ensure that no unauthorised persons will have access to them. If
        you interrupt and withdraw from the session before completion, no data will be saved. After completion of the
        experiment, however, your data cannot be deleted any more because they are stored anonymously.
    </p>

    <p>
        The data will only be published in a form that does not allow conclusions to be drawn about individuals.
        Thereby, the research is conducted in line with the ethical recommendations of the German Research Foundation.
